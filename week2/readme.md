The wallpaper I wanted to create was a grid based wallpaper and I wanted to explore creating a simple pattern for my single tile with two shapes - circle, triangle and colors and explore repeating it for all the size of the canvas divided into small grids. I wanted to explore randomizing the shapes based on some parameters like changing the vertices of triangles inside the tile and changing the color of shapes.

I explored different tiles from p5.js [color documentation](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/color). The challenge was trying to make a randomized grid aesthetically blend, uniform patterns were more pleasing to the eye, but trying to introduce randomness came with trying to analyze ways in which nearby tiles need to blend with existing tiles, it was more like a game of tetris, which I tried to in different ways but couldn't find a way to balance randomness with order. I liked the complete uniform designs which I have shared, which in itself forms new pattern when a tile comes together in a grid.
