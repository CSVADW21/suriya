The wallpaper I wanted to create was a grid based wallpaper and I wanted to explore creating a simple pattern for my single tile with two shapes - circle, triangle and colors and explore repeating it for all the size of the canvas divided into small grids. I wanted to explore randomizing the shapes based on some parameters like changing the vertices of triangles inside the tile and changing the color of shapes.
