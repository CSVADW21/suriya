# 3D Air Brush
To build a 3D painting tool, first of which is to explore a 3D brush and provide users with ability to paint in 3D. </br>
Presentation [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1IHDXUCGRRGfJmvA7q5QQh2LCm66MGu1DnkGx56SYFtQ/edit?usp=sharing).

### Core Features -
Preset of Brushes  </br>
Interactivity - Mouse & Keyboard | Camera-based Gesture <using the Gesture Library>  </br>
Color Picker in 3D <using 3D color picker>  </br>
Experimental - Generativity/Restrictions for Image based colors+  </br>
Import 3D Models, Save Sketches+  </br>
+based on time availability

### Proof of Concept -
Simulating a 3D brush using 3D cube and Peasy Cam3D in WebGL. </br>
Challenges - 3D camera orientation and mouse interactivity overlap </br>
